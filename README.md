Improved Low-rank Matrix Decompositions via the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform
=================

We comment on two randomized algorithms for constructing low-rank matrix decompositions. 
Both algorithms employ the Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transform.
We provide a novel analysis that significantly improves previous approximation bounds.
